What is Body Mass Index (BMI)?
========================================================
Healthcare professionals around the world often use Body Mass Index (BMI) when determining whether patients are underweight, healthy weight, overweight or clinically obese. People who are clinically obese have a greater risk of developing diabetes, stroke, some cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.

This application provides a quick and accurate measure of an individual's BMI. Therefore, allowing one to know which category he or she falls into. However, it must be noted that the BMI does have some shortcomings which will be discussed further. Therefore, this measure alone should be used as a sole indicator of one's overall health. 

How is your BMI calculated?
========================================================
 $$\frac{mass(kg)}{(height)^2(m)}$$ 
 
 OR 

 $$\frac{mass(lb)}{(height)^2(in)}*703$$ 
 
In this application the 2nd equation was utilized. 
 
The mass in pounds/lbs is divided by the square of the height in inches/in; and the multiplied by 703.

BMI Ranges
========================================================

Category| BMI range
--------|-----------:
Very severely underweight   |less than 15  
Severely underweight    |from 15.0 to 16.0
Underweight  |from 16.0 to 18.5
Normal (healthy weight)|from 18.5 to 25  
Overweight|from 25 to 30  
Obese Class I (Moderately obese)|from 30 to 35  
Obese Class II (Severely obese)  | from 35 to 40  
Obese Class III (Very severely obese)  |over 40 

BMI Exceptions and Shortcomings
======================================================== 
BMI has its drawbacks however. It does not take into account the patient's body fat content versus lean tissue (muscle) content. 

BMI overestimates the level of fat in more athletic individuals placing them into a higher BMI range. Conversely, the BMI underestimates the fat level in elderly and quite thin people; thus placing them into lower and healthier ranges.

Therefore, BMI should not be the sole measure in determining if one's weight is within a healthy range but should be coupled with additional measures such as hip to waist ratio measures; in additon to more comprehensive measures.
